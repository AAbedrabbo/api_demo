# API Demo

The purpose of this demo is to: 
- Showcase pulling data from a simple Weather API in Python. 
- Showcase potential for automation via a scheduler function (e.g. to run overnight and update an Excel sheet). 


## Files 
- `app.py` - This is the app that you can run to illustrate automating API requests and updating an Excel sheet. 
- `API_demo_results.xlsx` - The Excel sheet that gets updated when you run the app. 


## How to run 
1. Git clone this repo. 
2. Make sure you have all the necessary libraries. 
3. Go to your file and in Terminal, run `python3 app.py`. 

**Important Note**: In order to run the app, you'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Please either sign up to do this, or speak to the Decoded Product team to get a key.
